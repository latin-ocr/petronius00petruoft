Terentianus Maurus on Metre .-

We see that Horace nowhere employed verse of
this rhythm continuously, but the learned Arbiter
uses it osten in his works· You wffl remember these
lines, which we are used to sing: “ The maidens of
Memphis, made ready sor the rites ostloe Gods. The boy
volomd deep as the night with speaking gestures.”

Marius Victorinus III, 17 (Keil, &ammam-1⁸, VI ,138):
We know that the lyric poets inserted some lines of
this rhythm and form in their works, as we find too
in Arbiter, for example: “ The maidens os Memphis,
made ready for tlte rites of the Godsj’ and again
“Coloured deep as tloe night, [dancing] Egyptian danoes.”
