THE TEXT OF PETRONIUS
SIGLA

L = codex Scaligeranus, and editions of Tornaesius
and Pithoeus.

O = MSS. containing abridged excerpts of which cod.
Bernensis may be regarded as typical.

H = codex Traguriensis, our sole source for the
Cena Trimalchionis.

No'rE. A great number of minor corrections and
alternative readings are, owing to the demands of
space, omitted from the critical notes.
