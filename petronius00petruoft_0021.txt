lips daily, but is reproduced here alone in its fullnaes ;ι
and side by side with these mirrored vulgarisms the
gravity of the attack on professional rhetoric with
which the novel begins, and the weight of the
teacher’s defence, that the parentwill have education
set to a tune of his own calling; Eumolpus’s brilliant
exposition of the supremacy of the poet’s task over
that of the rhetorician or historian ; the curious, violent,
epic fragment by which he upholds his doctrine.

Petronius employed a pause in literary invention
and production in assimilating and expressing a view
upon the makers² of poems, prose, pictures, philoso-
pluas, aud statues, who preceded him, and thereby
deepened his interpretation of contemporary life. His
cynicism‚ his continual backward look at the splen-
dom-s and severitiae of earlier art and other morals,
are the inevitable outcome of this sels-education.

By far the most genuine and pathetic expressions
‘f his weariness are the poems which one is glad to be
able to attribute to him. The best of them speak of
quiet country and seaside, of love deeper than desire
and founded on the durable grace of mind as well as
the loveliness of the flesh, of simplicity and escape

25 and 26, bnt above all 16 and 27, which show (if they can
be by him) a side of Petronius entirely hidden in the satyriam.
