quiet inlets and a waveless shore: a third sets sail and

these petty ills? Pompey the Great, who made Pontus

is open and gapes wide, the dreadful company of Dis

river Hydaspes is in India.

days during the year 67 B-C.

He passed over these waters in 66 B-C. in the course of

his campaign against Mithridates.
