APOCOLOCYNTOSIS

years has been masquerading under' my name, has
done me the favour of murdering two Julias, great-
granddaughters of mine, ohe by cold steel and one by
starvation3 and one great-grandson, L. Silanus. See,
Jupiter, whether in a bad cause (at least it is your own)
youwillbe fair. Come tell me, blessed Claudius, why
of all those you killed, both men and women, with-
out 3 hearing, why you did not hear their side of the

mse first, before putting them to death? Where do
we find that custom? It is not done in heaven.

Look at Jupiter ε 311 thece years he has been king, and 1 1
never did more than once to break Vulcan's leg,

‘Whom seizing by the foot he cast from the madi, ⁵91
threshold of the sky‚’

and once he fell in a rage with his wife and sti-ung
her up: did he do any killing‘ You killed Messalina,
whose great-uncle I was no less than yours. ‘ Ι don’t
know: did you say? Curse you! that is just it: not
to know was worse than to kin. Caligula he went on
persecuting even when he was dead. Caligula mur-
dered his father-in-law, Claudius his son-in-law to '
boot. Caligula would not have Crassus’ son called
Great; Claudius gave him his name back, and took
away his head. In one family he destroyed Crassus,
Magnus, Scribonia, the Tristiom'as, Assario, noble
though they were; Crassus indeed such a fool that he
might have been emperor. Is this he you want now to
make a god? Look at his body, born under the wrath
of heaven! In fine, let him say as many as three words
quiekly, and he may have me for a slave. God! who
will worship this god, who will believe him? While
you make gods of such as he, no one will believe you
to be gods. To be brief, my lords: if Ι have lived
