SATYRICON

asking me to give him some writing to do, though he
does not want to work. Ι have another boy who is
no scholar, but very inquii-ing, and can teach you
more than he knows himself. So on holidays he
generally comes home, and is quite pleased whatever
you give him. Ι bought the child some books with
red-letter headings in them a little time ago. Ι
want him to have a smack of law in order to manage
the property. Law has bread and butter in it. He
has dipped quite deep enough into literature. If he
is restless‚ I mean to have him learn a trade, a barber
or an aucfioneer, or at least a barrister, something
that he can carry to the grave with him. So 1 drum
it into him every day: ‘Mark my words, Primigenius‚
whatever you learn, you learn for your own good.
Look at Phileros, the barrister: if he had not worked,

, he would not be keeping the wolf from the door to-

day. It is not so long since he used to carry things
round on his back and sell them, and now he makes a
brave show even against Norbanus. Yes, education is
a treasure, and culture never dies.' ”

Gossip of this kind was in the air, when Trimalchio
came in mopping his brow, and washed his hands in
scent. After a short pause, he said, “You will excuse
me, gentlemen? My bowels have not been working
for several days. All the doctors are puzzled. Still,
Ι found pomegranate rind useful, and pinewood boiled
in vinegar. I hope now my stomach will learn to ob-
serve its old decencies. Besides, Ihave such rumblings
inside me you would think there was a bull there. So i1
any of you gentlemen wishes to retire there is no need
to be shy about it. We were none of us born quite
solid. I cannot imagine any torture like holding one—
nelf in. T'ne one thing Jupiter himself cannot forbid
