SATYRICON

at this inquisitive opening3 I was afraid 1 had let
Ascyltos’s double into the lodgings. Eumolpus per-
sisted, and, when the boy brought him a drink, said,
“ 1 like you better than the whole ψαύων He
greedily drank the cup dry, and said he had never
taken anything with a sharper tang in it. “ Why, Ι
was nearly flogged while I was washing,'' he cried,
“because Ι tried to go round the bath and recite
poetry to the people sitting in it, and when 1 was
thrown out of the bathroom as if it were a theatre‚ Ι
began to look round all the corners, and shouted for
Encolpius in a loud voice. In another part of the
place a naked young man who had lost his clothes
kept clamouring for Giton with equally noisy indigna-
tion. The boys laughed at me with saucy mimicry as
if 1 were crazy, but a large crowd surrounded him,
clapping their hands and humbly admiring. Habebat

laciniam fascini crederes. O iuvenem laboriosum:
puto illum pridie incipere, postero die finire. So he
found an ally at once: some Roman knight or other,
a low fellow, they said, put his own clothes on him as
he strayed round, and took him off home, I suppose,
ut tam magna fortuna solus uteretur. Ι should never
have got my own clothes back from the troublesome
attendant if I had not produced a voucher. Tanto

Eumolpus told me all this, my expression kept
changing, for of course I laughed at my enemy’s
straits and frowned on his fortune. But anyhow
Ι kept quiet as if Ι did not know what the story was
about, and set forth our bin of fare. . . .
“ What we may have we do not care about; our 93

minds are bent on folly and love what is troublaeome.
