POEMS

At πᾶσι in bed, 1 had scarce begun to enjoy the first 26
silence of night, and to give up my conquered eyes
to sleep, when fierce Love took hold of me and drew
me up by the hair, and tore me, bidding me watch
till day. “Ah‚ my slave‚” he said, “thou lover of
a thousand girls, must thou lie alone here, alone, oh
hard of heart?” 1 leaped up, and with bare feet and
disordered raiment started on every path and found
a way by none. Now 1 run, now to move is weariness:
Ι repentof turning back, and am ashamed to halt in
the midst of the road. Lo, the voices of men and the
roar of the streets, the singing of birds and the faith-
ful company of watchdogs are all silent. 1 alone of all
men dread both sleep and my bed, and follow thy
oommand, great Lord of desire.

Long may that night be dear to us, Nealce, that 27
first laid you to rest upon my heart. Dear be the
bed and the genius of the couch, and the silent lamp
that saw you come sostly to do our-pleasure. Come,
then, let us endure though we have grown older, and
employ the years which a brief delay will blot out.

It is lawful and right to prolong an old love: grant

thaat ἔδει we began in haste may not hastily be
en e

Thea pleasure of the act of love is gross and brief, 28
and love once consummated brings loathing aster it.
Let us then not rush blindly thither straightway like
lustful beasts, for love sickens and the flame dies
down; but even so, even so, let us keep etex-nal holi-
