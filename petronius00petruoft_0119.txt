was dinted like a bronze bowl; then he took a little
hammer out of his pocket and made the cup quite
sound again without any trouble. After doing this
he thought he had himself seated on the throne of
Jupiter, especially when Caesar said to him: ‘Does
anyone else know how to blow glass like this? Just
see what happened. He said not, and then Caesar
had him beheaded. Why? Because if his invention

Myself Ι have a great passion for silver. Ι own about 52
a hundred four-gallon cups engraved with Cassandra
killing her children, and they lying there dead in the
most lifelike way. Ι have a thousand jugs which Mum-
mius¹ lest to my patron, and on them you see Dae-
dalus shutting Niobe into the Trojan horse. And Ι
have got the fights between Hermeros and Petraites²
on my cups, and every cup is a heavy one; for Ι do
not sell my connoisseurship for any moneyss’

As he was speaking, a boy dropped a cup. Trimal-

Trimalchiof ‘as if I should be hard on you! Ι advise
you to prevail upon yourself not to be stupid.” In
the end we induced him to let the boy off. As soon
as he was forgiven the boy ran round the table. . . .

Then Trimalchio shouted, “Out with water! In
with wine ! '’ . . . We took up the joke, especially Aga-
memnon, who knew how to earn a second invitation

¹The name is suggested by the previous references to
Corinth. L. Mummius Achaicus captured and saeked Corinth
mzigiligbcmted gladiators of the period. Trimalchio' in c. 7¹
orders the fights of Petraites to be depicted on his tomb.
