POEMS

My little house is covered by a roof that fears no 8
barm, and the grape swollen with wine hangs from the
finiti-'ul elm. The boughs yleld chen-ies, the orchards
ruddy apples, and the trees sacred to Panas¹ break under
the wealth of their branches. And now where the
smooth soil drinks from the runnels of the spring,
Corycian kale springs up for me and creeping mallows,
and the poppy with promise of untroubled sleep.
Moreover, if my pleasure is to lay snares for birds, or
if Ι choose rather to entrap the timid deer, or draw out
the quivering fish on slender line, so much deceit is all
that is known to my humble fields. Go, then, and
ban-ter the hours of flying life for rich banquets. My
prayer is that since at the last the same end waits for
me, it may find me here, here call me to account for
the time that 1 have spent.

Is it not enough that mad youth engulfs us, and 9
our good name is sunk in reproach and sweeps us
astray? Behold ! even bondmen and the rabble that is
kindred to the mire wanton amid our gathered
hoards! The low slave enjoys the treasure of a king-
dom, and the thrall's room shames Vesta and the cot-
tage of Romulus. So goodness lies obscured in the
deep mud, and the fleet of the unrighteous carries
snowy sails.

So, too, the body will shut in the belly's wind, 10
which, when it labours to come fort-h again from its
deep dungeon, prizes forth a way by sharp blows: and

¹The olive, which she gave to Athens. By this gift, which
the Gods considered more usesul than the horse given by
Poseidon, she became the presiding deity of the city.
