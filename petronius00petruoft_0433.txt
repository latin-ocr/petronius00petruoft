refuses to hear the other side and passoe sentence

he were not relieved; the drag must be put at last on
wretched Ixion’s wheel. But it was determined not to
let off any of the old stagers‚ lest Claudius should dare
to hope for any such relies. It was agreed that some
new punishment must be devised: they must devise
some new task, something senseless‚ to suggest some
craving without result. Then Aeacus decreed he .

At once the poor wretch began his’ fruitless task of
hunting for the dice, which for ever slipped from his
fingers.

now had got 'em,

The little cubes would vanish thro’ the perforated
bottom.

Then he would piek ’em up again, and once more set

The dice but served him the same trick: away they
went a-flying.

So still he tries, and still he fails; still searching long
he lingers;
