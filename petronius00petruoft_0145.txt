SATYRICON

came to my love's house. Ι went in like a corpse,
and nearly gave up the ghost, the sweat ran down
my legs, my eyes were dull, Ι could hardly be revived.
My dear Melissa was surprised at my being out so late,
and said, ‘If you had come earlier you might at least
have helped us; a wolf got into the house and worried
all our sheep, and let their blood like a butcher. But
he did not make fools of us, even though he got off ;
for our slave made a hole in his neck with a spear.’
When 1 heard this, Ι could not keep my eyes shut any
longer, but at break of day I rushed back to my master
Gaius’s house like a defrauded publican, and when l
came to the place where the clothes were turned into
stone, I found nothing but a pool of blood. But when
Ι reached home, my soldier was lying in bed like an ox,
with a doctor looking after his neck. Ι realized that
he was a werewolf, and I never could sit down to a
meal with him afterwards, not if you had killed me
first. Other people may think what they like about
this3 but may all your guardian angels punish me if 1
am lying.”

We were all dumb with astonishment, but Trimal- 63
chio said, “1 pick no holes in your story3 by the soul
of truth, how my hair stood on end! For I know that
Niceros never talks nonsense: he is very dependable,
and not at all a chatterbox. Now Ι want to tell you
a ’tale of horror myself: but I'm a donkey on the tiles
compared with him. thile I still had hair down niy
back, for I lived delicately¹ from my youth up, my
master’s favourite died. Oh! he was a pearl, one in
a thousand, and a mirror of pel-fection! So while his
poor mother was bewailing him, and several of us were

¹Literally “a Chian life,'’ i.e. luxurious and vicious.
Thucydides calls the Chiaus shameless.
