SATYRICON

were not to be compared with him, until the servants
came and spread over the couches coverlets painted
with nets, and men lying in wait with hunting spears,
and all the instruments of the chase. We were still
wondering where to turn our expectations, when a
great shout was raised outside the dining-room, and
in came some Spartan hounds too, and began run-
ning round the table. A tray was brought in aster
them with a wild boar of the largest size upon it,

wearing a cap of freedom, with two little baskets woven ⁸

of palm-twigs hanging from his tusks‚ one full of dry
dates and the other of fresh. Round it lay sucking-
pigs made of simnel cake with their mouths to the
teats, thereby showing that we had a sow before us.
These suckjng-pigs were for the guests to take away.

dividethe boar, but a big bearded man with bands
wound round his legs, and a spangled hunting-coat of
damasked silk, who drew a hunting-kn'ife and plunged
it hard into the boar’s side. A number of thrushes flew
out at the blow. As they ssuttered round the dining-room
there were fowlers ready with limed twigs who caught
them in a moment. Trimalchio ordered everybody to be
given his own portion, and added: “ Now you see what
fine acorns the woodland boar has been eating.” Then
boys came and took the baskets which hung from her
jaws and distributed fresh and dry dates to the guests.

Meantime 1 had got a quiet corner to myself, and had
gone off on a long train of speculation,—why the pig
had come in with a cap of freedom on. After turning

the problem over every way1 Ι ventured to put the

ιΒαιτιῖιιςίας may be derived from baceolus (Gk βάκηλος) a
blockhead, and ludere, hence meaning perhaps ‘⁴ every kind
of foolish explanation of the riddle.”
