SATYRICON

But Ι tried to please my master, a fine dignified
gentleman whose little finger was worth more than
your whole body. And there were people in the
house who put out a foot to trip me up here and
there. But still—God bless my master !—I struggled
through. These are real victories: being born free is
as easy as saying, ‘ Come here! But why do yot· stare
at me now like a goat in a field of vetch?’'

At this remark Giton, who was standing by my
feet, burst out with an unseemly laugh, which he had
now been holding in for a long while. Ascyltos’s
enemy noticed him, and turned his abuse on to the
boy. “ What,” he said, “are you laughing too,
you curly-headed onion? A merry Saturnalia indeed:
what, have we December here? When did you pay
five per cent on your freedom? He doesn’t know
what to do, the gallows-bird, the crows’—meat. I will
call down the wrath of Jupiter at once on you and the
fellow who cannot keep you in order. As sure as 1
get my bellyfull, I would have given you what you
deserve now on the spot, but for my respect for my
fellow-freedman. We are getting on splendidly, but
those fellows are fools, who don't keep you in hand.
Yes, like master, like man. Ι can scarcely hold my-
self in, and I am not naturally hot-tempered, but

when I once begin Ι do not care twopence for my own
mother. Depend upon it, I shall meet you somewhere
in public, you rat, you puff-ball. I will not grow an
ineh up or down until I have put your master's head
in a nettle-bed,1 and I shall have no mercy on you, I
can tell you, however much you may call upon Jupiter
