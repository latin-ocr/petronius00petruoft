POEMS

day, and lie with thy lips to mine. No toil is here and
no shame: in this, delight has been, and is, and long
shall be ; in this there is no diminution, but a begin-
ning everlastingly. '

To love and accuse at one time were a labour
Hercules himself could scarce have borne.

Our eyes deceive us, and our wandering senses
weigh down our reason and tell us falsehoods. For
the tower which stands almost four-square has its
corners blunted at a distance and becomes rounded.
The full stomach turns from the honey of Hybla, and
the nose often hates the scent of cinnamon. One

thing could not please us more or less than another,

ffi the senses strove in set conflict with wavering
ce.

It is not the shrines of the gods, nor the powers of
the air, that send the dreams which mock the mind
with flitting shadows3 each man makes dreams for
himself. For when rest lies about the limbs subdued
by sleep‚ and the mind plays with no weight upon
it, it pursues in the darkness whatever was its task
by daylight. The man who makes towns tremble in
war, and overwhelms unhappy cities in flame, sees
arms, and routed hosts, and the deaths of kings, and
plains streaming with outpoured blood. They whose
life is to plead cases have statutes and the courts
before their eyes, and look with terror upon the
judgement-seat surrounded by a throng. ΤΙιε miser
hides his gains and discovers buried treasure.
