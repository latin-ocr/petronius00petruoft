- SATYRICON

We threw ourselves into bed md spent the rest of
the night without terrors. . . .

The third day had come. A good dinner was pro-
mised. But we were bruised and sore. Escape was
better even than rest. We were making some melan-
choly plans for avoiding the coming storm, when one of
Agamemnon’s servants came up as we stood hesitating,
and said, “ Do you not know at whose house it is to-
day? Trimalchio, a very rich man, who has a clock
and a uniformed trumpeter in his dining-room‚ to keep
telling him how much of his life is lost and gone.” We
forgot our troubles and hurried into our clothes, and
told Giton, who till now had been waiting on us very
willingly, to follow us to the baths. We began to
take a stroll in evening dress to pass the time, or
rather to joke and mix with the groups of players,
when all at once we saw a bald old man in a reddish
vshirt playing at ball with some long-haired boys. It
was not the boys that attracted our notice, though
they deserved it, but the old gentleman, who was in
his house-shoes‚ busily engaged with a green ball.
He never picked it up if it touched the ground. A
slave stood by with a bagful and supplied them to the
players. We also observed a new feature in the game.
Two eunuchs were standing at different points in the
group. One held a silver jordan, one counted the
balls, not as they flew from hand to hand in the rigour
of the game, but when they dropped to the ground.
We were amazed at such a display, and then Menelaus¹
ran up and said, “This is the man who will give you
places at his table: indeed what you see is the over-
ture to his dinner.” Menelaus had just finished when

¹ Agamemnon’s assistant, who would take junior classes in
rhetoric. He is called antescholanus, assistant tutor, in c. 81.
