SATYRICON

the wife of Terentius the inn-keeper; you remember
her, Melissa of Tarentum, a pretty round thing. But
1 swear it was no base passion31 did not care about
her 111 that way, but rather because she had a beauti-
ful nature. If Ι asked her for anything it was never
refused me3 if she made twopence I had a penny;
whatever Ι 11311 Ι put into her pocket, and Ι was never
taken in. Now one day her husband died on the
estate} So I buckled 011 my shield and greaves, and
schemed how to come at her: and ὅ you know,
one’ 3 friends turn up in tight places. My master
happened to have gone to Capua to look after some
silly 111131110332 01 other. 1 seized my opportunity, 31111 62
persuaded a guest in our house to come with me as
far as the fifth milestone. He was a soldier, 31111
as brave as Heu. so we trotted off about cock-
erow3 the moon shone like high noon. We got among
the tombstones3: my man went aside to look at the
epitaphs, I sat down with my heart full of song and
began to count the graves. Then when I looked
round at my friend, he stripped himself and put all
his clothes by the roadside. My heart was in my mouth,
but 1 stood like a dead man. He made a ring of water
round his clothes and suddenly turned into a wolf.
Ρ10330 do not think 1 am joking; Ι would not lie
about this for any fortune in the world. But as Ι was
saying, aster 110 11311 turned into a wolf, he began to
howl, and ran off into the woods. At first Ι hardly
knew where Ι was, then I went up to take his clothes;
but they had all turned into stone. No one could be
nearer dead with terror than Ι was. But Ι drew my
sword and went slaying shadows all the way till Ι

'Terentius was a slave managing the tavem for his master.
’Lit., elegant trash. ⁸ They would be by the madside.
