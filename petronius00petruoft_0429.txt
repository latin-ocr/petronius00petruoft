APOCOLOCYNTOSIS

Once ruler of fivescore cities in Crete,

Must yield to his better and take a back seat.

Moum, mourn, pettifoggers, ye venal crew,

And you, minor poets, woe, woe is to you!

And you above all, who get rich quick

By the rattle of dice and the three card trick.’'

Claudius was charmed to hear his own praises sung, 13
and would have stayed longer to see the show. But
the Talthybius ¹ of the gods laid a hand on him, and
led him across the Campus Martius, first wrapping his
head up close that no one might know him, until be-
twixt Tiber and the Subway he went down to the
lower regions. His freedman Narcissus had gone
down before him by a short cut, ready to weleome his
mster. Out he comes to meet him, smooth and
shining (he had Just lest the bath), and says 118.

‘What make the gods among mortals?'' “Look
alive,” says Mercury,‘ ‘go and tell them we are
coming. '⁸ Away he flew, quicker than tongue can tell
it. Itis easy going by that road, all down hill. So
although Claudius had a touch of the gout, in a trice
they were come to Dis’ s door. There lay Cerberus,
or, as Horace puts it, the hundred· headed monster. ⁰3⁶⁸}st
Claudius was a trifle perturbed (it was a little white ⁵
bitch he used to keep for a pet) when he spied this
black shag- haired hound, not at all the kind of thing
you could wish to meet in the dark.1n a loud voice
he cried, “Claudius' 13 coming!” All marched before
him singing‚ “The lost is found, O let us rejoice
together!” ’² Here were found C. Silius consul elect,
J uncus the ex- -p,raetor Sextus Traulus‚ M. Helvius,

¹Talthybi us was a 118 rald‚ an nd nuntius ’13 obviously a gloss
on tbi 13. He me ans Mer rcury.

² wi th a slight change, a cry used' m the worshi ip of Osi iris.
