SATYRICON

the market, hoping that the bright colour might
attract a purchaser. In a little while a countryman,
whom 1 knew by sight, came up with a girl, and
began to examine the cloak narrowly. Ascyltos in
turn cast a glauce at the shoulders of our country
customer,1 and was suddenly struck dumb with astonish-
ment. 1 could not look upon the man myself without a
stit, for he was the person, I thought, who had found

4 the shirt in the lonely spot where we lost it. He was
ζ certainly the very man. But as Ascyltos was afraid to
, trust his eyes for sear of doing something rash, he first

came up close as if he were a purchaser, and pulled the
shirt off the countryman's shoulders‚ and then felt it
carefully. By a wonderful stroke of luck the country- 13
man had never laid his meddling hands on the seam,
and he was offering the thing for sale with a conde-
* scending air as a beggar’s leavings. When Ascyltos
saw that our savings were untouched, and what a poor
creature the seller was, he took me a little aside from
the crowd, and said, “Do you know, brother, the
treasure 1 was grumbling at losing has come back to us.
, That is the shirt, and I believe it is still full of gold
pieces: they have never been touched. What shall we
do? How shall we assert our legal rights ?”

1 was delighted, not only because 1 saw a chance of
profit, but because fortune had relieved me of a very
disagreeable suspicion. I was against any roundabout
methods. Ι thought we should proceed openly by
civil process, and obtain a decision in the courts if
they refused to give up other people's property to
the rightful owners.
