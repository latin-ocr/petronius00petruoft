POEMS

The remaining two poems are found in cod. Vos-
sianus LF. 111, a MS. of the 9th century. They are
attributed to Petronius by the MS„ and follow two
poems found in the MSS of the novel (e. 14· and c.
83). Their general resemblance would betray their

authorship.
For a discussion of these MSS. see Baehrens,

PogtfiaeffLatini Minores, vol. iv, pp. 11, 13 and 19. Also
