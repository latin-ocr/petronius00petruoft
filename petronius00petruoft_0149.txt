SATYRICON

was taken with the gout. , Ι11 1118 days when I was a
young fellow 1 nearly got consumption with singing.
How I could dance and recite and imitate the talk in
a barber’s shop! Was there ever my equal‚ except
the one and only Apelles ?'' And he put his hand to
his mouth and whistled out some offensive stuff I did
not catch: he declared asterwards it was Greek.
Then Trimalchio, after imitating a man with a trum-

Croesus. The creature had blear eyes and very bad teeth,
and was tying up 311 unnaturally obese black puppy in a
green handkerchief, and then putting a broken piece of

dog, who did not want it and was siek. This reminded
Trimalchio of his duties, and he ordered them to bring

filled the dining-room with a most hideous barking,
and nearly tore Croesus’s little Pearl to pieces. And
