SATY RICON

which would not serve to make a decent patchwork. 1⁵
Ascyltos now cleverly stopped their laughter by calling
for silence and saying, “‚Well you see, every one has
an affection for his own things. If they will give us
our shirt, they shall have their cloak.’' The country·
man and the woman were satisfied with this exchange,
but by this time some policemen had been called in to
punish us; they wanted to make a profit out of the
cloak, and tried. to persuade us to leave the disputed
2 property with them and let a judge look into our com-
? plaints the next day. They urged that besides the
21 counter-claims to these garments, a far graver question
- arose, since each party must lie under suspicion ofthiev-
ing. It was suggested that trustees should be appointed,
and one of the traders, a bald man with a spotty fore-
head, who used sometimes to do law work, laid hands
on the cloak and declared that he would produce it
to-morrow. But clearly the object was that the cloak
should be deposited with a pack of thieves and be
seen no more, in the hope that we should not keep
our appointment, for fear of being charged.

It was obvious that our wishes coincided with his, and
chance came to support the wishes of both sides. The
countryman lost his temper when we said his rags
must be shown in public, threw the shirt in Ascyltos's
face, and asked us, now that we had no grievance‚ to
give up the cloak which had raised the whole quarrel. . . .

We thought we had got back our savings. We
hurried away to the inn and shut the door, and
then had a laugh at the wits of our false accuser-s
and at the dealers too, whose mighty sharpness had
returned our money to us. “1 never want to grasp
what 1 desire at once, nor do easy victories delight
me.”
