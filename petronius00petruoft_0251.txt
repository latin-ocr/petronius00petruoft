fists, and even the crioe of women were not unheard on
the field. The helmsman alone swore that he would give
up minding the ship if this madness, which had been
stirred up to suit a pack of scoundrels, did not stop.
None the less, the fury of the combatants persisted‚ the
enemy fighting for revenge and we for dear life. Many
fell on both sides without fatal results, still more got
bloody wounds and retired in the style of a real battle,
and still we all raged implacably. Then the gallant
Giton turned a razor on himself and threatened to put
an end to our troubles by sels-mutilation‚ and Tryphaena
averted the horrible disaster by a fair promise of free-

- dom. I listed abarber’s knife to my throat several times,

no more meaning to kill myself than Giton meant to do
what he threatened. Still he filled the tragic part more
reeklessly, because he knew that he was holding the
very razor with which he had already made a cut on his
throat. Both sides were drawn up in battle array, and it
was plain that the fight would be no ordinary affair, when
the helmsman with difficulty induced Tryphaenato con-
clude a treaty like a true diplomat. So the usual formal
undertakings were exchmged, and she waved an olive·
branch which she took from the ship’s figure-head, and
ventured to come up and talk to us: “ What madness,”
she cried, “is turning peace into war? What have our
hands done to deserve it? No Trojan herol carries the
bride of the cuckold son of Atreus in this fleet, nor
does frenzied Medea² fight her foe by slaying her
brother. But love despised is powerful. Ah ! who
courts destruction among these waves by drawing

¹ Paris.

² Absyrtus, Medea·s brother, and son of Aietae, king of

Colchis, plotted against Jason, who had come secking the
Golden Fleece. Medea killed him and ssed with Jason.
