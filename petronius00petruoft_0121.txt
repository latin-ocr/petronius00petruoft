But a clerk quite interrupted his passion for the
dance by reading as though from the gazette: “July

was a fire in our gardens at Pompeii, which broke out
in the house of Nasta the bailiff.” “Stop,'' said Tri-
malchio, “When did I buy an?⁷ gardens at Pompeii?’'
“Last year‚'’ said the clerk, ‘so that they are not
entered in your accounts yet.'' Trimalchio glowed
with passion, and said, “1 will not have any property
which is bought in my name entered in my accounts
