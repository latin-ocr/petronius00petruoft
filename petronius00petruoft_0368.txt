TITUS PETRONIUS ARBITER

INTRODUCTION

Of the poems which follow, 1-17 are found in the
cod. Vossianus L. Q. 86, a MS. of the 9th century.
They follow a number of epigrams attributed to
Seneca and are not attributed by the MS. to Petronius.
But 3, 1 and 13, 6-9 are quoted by Fulgentius (myth.
Ι, 1, p. 31 and III, 9, p. 126) as from Petronius, while
the general resemblance to Petronius led Scaliger to
attribute the remainder to the same author. Though
absolute proof of the correctness of this attribution
is lacking, most readers will feel little doubt that
Scaliger was right.

18—29l were contained in a MS. once at Beauvais and
now lost. The contents of this codex Bellovacensis

were published by Claude Binet in 1 579. The last two ' K* ν

poems were not, according to Binet, given to Petro-
nius by the MS„ and I have included them with
some hesitation. But as Binet saw, the resemblance

to the style and tone of Petronius is considerable, ’

and they are therefore given here. The six poems
which followed in this MS. are given by Baehrens
(P.L.M. iv. 103-8) to Petronius. But they have no
particular affinity with the work of Petronius, and as
they have inserted among them in Binet’s book a
number of poems which are admittedly by Luxorius
(see Baehrens, op. cit. App. Crit. on P.L.M. iv. 104),

they are not included here.

¹No. 20 is also contained in cod. Paris, 10318 (Salma-
ἰίἒυιὲςε), cod. Vossianus, L. Q 86, cod. Paris, 8071 (Thun-
