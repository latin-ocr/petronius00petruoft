roused. ΤΙιε warch} who were patrolling the streets
close by, thought Trimalchio’s house was alight, and
suddenly burst in the door and began with water and
axoe to do their duty in creating a disturbance. My
friends and 1 seized this most welcome opportunity,
outwitted Agamemnon, and took to our heels as
quickly as if there were a real fire.

There was no guiding torch to show us the way as
we wandered3 it was now midnight, and the silence
gave usno prospect of meeting anyone with a light.
Moreover we were drunk, and our ignorance of the
quarter would have puzzled us even in the daytime.
So after dragging our bleeding feet nearly a whole
hour over the flints and broken pots which lay out in the
road, we were at last put straight by Giton’s clevernaes.
The eareful child had been afraid of losing his way
even in broad daylight, and had marked all the posts
and columns with chalk ;these lines shone through the
blackest night, and their brilliant whitenoes directed
our lost footsteps. But even when we reached our
lodgings our agitation was not relieved. For our friend
the old woman had had a long night swilling with her
lodgers, and would not have noticed if you had set
a light to her. We might have had to sleep on the
doorstep if Trimalchio's courier had not come up in
state with ten carts. After making a noise for a little
while he broke down the house-door and let us in by it. . .

Ah ! gods and goddesses, what a night that was, how
soft was the bed. We lay in a warm embrace and
with kisses everywhere made exchange of our wander-
ing spirits. Farewell, all earthly troubles. So began
my destruction.
