INTRODUCI'ION

This piece is ascribed to Seneca by ancient tradition3
it is impossible to prove that it is his, and impossible
to prove that it is not. The matter will probably con-
tinne to be deeided by every one according to his
view of Seneca's character and abilities: in the mat-
ters of style and of sentiment much may be said on
both sides. Dion Cassius (lx, 35) says that Seneca
composed an ἀποκολοκύντωσις or Pumpkinification ot
Claudius aster his death, the title being a parody of
the usual ‹imoimo-m but this title is not given in the
MSS. of the Ludus de Morte Claudii, nor is there any-
thing in the piece which suits the title very well.

As a literary form, the piece belongs to the class
called Satura Menippea, a satiric medley in prose and

verse.

This text is that of Buecheler, with a few trifling
changes, which are indicated in the notes. We have

been courteously allowed by Messrs Weidmann to use
this text. I have to acknowledge the help of Mr Ball’s

notes, from which Ι have taken a few references ; but
my translation was made many years ago.
