INTRODUCHON

clothes dealer, overwhelms him with a flood of subur-
ban chatter about games, and children, and chickens,
and the material blessings of education. But Gany·
mede is the sole character in Petronius’s novel who

brings to light the reverse side of Trimalchio’s splen· -

dour. A system of local government which showers
honours upon vulgarity‚ and allows Trimalchio his
bath, his improved sanitation‚ his host of servants, his
house with so many doors that no guest may go in and
out by the same one, is invariably true to type in
leaving poor men to die in the streets. The very
existence of poverty becomes dim for Trimalchio, half
unreal, so that he can jest at Agamemnon for taking
as the theme of a set speech the eternal quarrel of
rich and poor.

Between rich and poor in Cumae the one link is
commerce in vice. Trimalchio finds Fortunata the
chorus-girl standing for sale in the open market, and
calls her up to be the partner of his sterile and un-
meaning prodigality. She has learnt all the painful
lessons of the slums; she will not grace Trimalchio's
table until dinner is over, and she has seen the plate
safely collected from his guests, and the broken meats
apportioned to his slaves ; she knows the sting 01
jealousy, and the solace of intoxication or tears ; nor-
mally she rules him, as Petruchio ruled Katharine‚ with
loud assertion and tempest of words. The only other
woman present at the dinner, Scintilla, the wife of
Trimalchio's friend Habinnas, a monumental mason,
is more drunken and unseemly‚ and leaves behind her
a less sharp taste of character.

Trimalchio's dinner breaks up with a false alarm of
fire, and the infamous heroes of the story give Aga·
memnon the slip. Trimalchio vanishes.and withhisloss
