POEMS

wine. ΤΙιε bull loves to change his valley-pasture‚ and
the wild beast maintains his zest by change of food.
Even to be bathed in the light of day is pleasant only
because the night-honr races back with altered steeds.

A wife is a burden imposed by law, and’shoum be 5
loved like one’s fortune. But Ι do not wish to love
even my fortune for ever.

Leave thine home, Ο youth, and seek out alien 6
shores: a lar-ger range of life is ordained for thee. Yield
not to missortune3 the far-off Danube shall know thee,
the cold North-wind, and the untroubled kingdoms of
Canopus, and the men who gaze on the new birth of

’ Phoebus or upon his setting: he that disembarks on

distant sands, becomes thereby the greater man

For there is naught that may not serve the need of 7
mortal men, and in adversity despised things help us.
So when a ship sinks, yellow gold weighs down its
possessor, while a flimsy oar bears up the shipwrecked
body. When the trumpets sound‚ the savage’s knife
stands drawn at the rich man’s throat3 the poor man’s
rags wear the amulet of safety.
