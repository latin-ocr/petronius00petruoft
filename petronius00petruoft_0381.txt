Outward beauty is not enough, and the woman who 16
would appear fair must not* be content with any com-
mon muer. Words, wit, play, sweet talk and laugh-
ter, surpass the work of too simple nature. For all
expense of art seasons beauty‚ and naked loveliness is
wasted all in vain, if it have not the will to please.

So, contrary to the known operations of nature, the 17
raven lays her eggs when the crops are ripe. So the
she—bear shapes her cubs with her tongue, and the
fish is ignorant of love’s embrace, yet brings forth
young. So the tortoise, sacred to Phoebus, delivered
by the will of mother Lucina, hatches her eggs with
the warmth of her nostrils. So the bee, begotten
without wedlock from the woven cells, throbs with
life and fills her camp with bold soldiery. The strength
of nature lies not in holding on one even way, but she
loves to change the fashion of her laws.

My¹ birthplace was India’s glowing shore, where the 1 8
day returns in brilliance with fiery orb. Here I was
born amid the worship of the gods, and exchanged
my barbaric speech for the Latin tongue. O healer of
Delphi, now dismiss thy swans ; here is a voice more
worthy to dwell within thy temple.

ιΑ parret is speaking.
