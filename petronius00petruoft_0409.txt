APOCOLOCYNTOSIS

mest, he αἰαὶ out, “011 clear, oh dear! 1 think 1
have made a mess of myself.” Whether he did or no,
Ι cannot say, but certain it *is he always did make a

mess of everything.
What happened next on earth it is mere waste of 5

² time to tell, for you know it all well enough, and

there is no fear of your ever forgetting the impression
which that public rejoicing made on your memory.
No one forgets his own happiness. What happened
in heaven you shall hear: for proof please apply to my
informant. Word comes to Jupiter that a stranger
had ari-lved,a man of fair height and hair well sprinkled
with grey; he seemed to be threatening something,
for he wagged his head ceaselessly3 he dragged the
right foot. They asked him what nation he was of;
he answered something in a confused mumbling
voice: his language they did not understand. He
was no Greek and no Roman, nor of any known race.
On this Jupiter bids Hercules go and find out what
country he comes from ; you see Hercules had travelled
over the whole world, and might be expected to know
all the nations in it. But Hercules, the first glimpse he
got, was really much taken aback, although not all
the monsters in the world could frighten him; when
he saw this new kind of object, with its extraordinary
gait, and the voice of no terrestrial beast, but such
as you might hear in the leviathans of the deep,
hoarse and inarticulate, he thought his thirteenth
labour had come upon him. When he looked closer,
the thing seemed to be a kind of man. Up he goes,
then, and says what your Greek finds readiest to his
wegffio art thou, and what thy people? Who thy od.i‚1⁷
parents, where thy home?’'
