THE TEXT OF PETRONIUS
'Hie sources for the text of Petronius fall into three

* gronpa

(1) The ωάα Leidensis (le) written by Scaliger

’ and the editions of the de Tournes (Tornaesius) 1575

and Pithou (Pithoeus) l 577. These are our authorities

for the fuller collection of excerpts. This source is
known as L.

(2) A number of MSS. of which codes Emensis
(357) of the lOth century is typical. This group is
our authority for the abridged collection of excerpts
and is known collectively as O.

(3) The codex T raguriensis (Paris 7989) of the 15th

century, which, save for a very few brief excerpts in
⁷ L and O, is our sole authority for the cena Trimalchi-
σφώ. This MS. was discovered in 1650 at Trau in
Dalmatia. It is known as H.

The text was not put on a scientific basis till the
appearance of Buecheler's Editio maior in 1862.

In the Apparatus Criticus the source of the most
important corrections is stated, and followed by the
reading given by Buecheler in his editio minor as the
probable reading of the archetype or as the oldest

“ reading available. The sources from which the differ-
, ent portions of the text are derived are indicated by

the letters in the margin of the text.
