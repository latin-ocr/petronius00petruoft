ways angry against power too firmly seated, everlasting
lover of change and quick forsaker of thy conquests,
dost not thou feel thy spirit crushed under the weight
of Rome, and that thou canst not further raise up the
mass that is doomed to fall? The youth of Rome
contemns its own strength, and groans under the

mountains are hoUowed out until the caves groan,
and while men turn precious stones to their empty
purposes, the ghosts of hell declare their hopes of
winning heaven Arise, then, Chauce‚ change thy
looks of peace to war, harry the Roman, and let my
kingdom have the dead. It is long now since my
lips were wet with blood, and never has my loved
Tisiphone bathed her thirsty limbs since the sword
