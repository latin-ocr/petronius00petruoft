Honest Heaven ordained that all things which can 22
end our wretched complaints should be ready to hand.
Common green herbs and the ben-ies that grow on
rough brambles allay the gnawing hunger of the belly.
A fool is he who goes thirsty with a river close by,
and shivers in the east wind while a blazing flre roars
on the warm hearth. The law sits armed by the
threshold of a wauton bride; the girl who lies on a
lawful bed knows no sear. The wealth of nature gives
us enough for our fill: that which unbridled vanity
teaches us to pursue has no end to it.

Doves have made a nest in the soldier's helmet: 23
see how Venus loveth Mars.

The J ew may worship his pig-god and clamour in 24
the ears of high heaven, but unless ¹he also cuts back
his foreskin with the knife, he shall go forth from the
holy city cast forth from the people, and transgress
the sabbath by breaking the law of fasting.

This is the one nobility and proof of honourable 25
estate, that a man's hands have shown no sear.
