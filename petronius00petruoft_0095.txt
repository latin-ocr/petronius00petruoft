SATY RICON

guoetion which was troubling me to my old informant.

Your humble servant can explain that too ; ’¹ he said,
“ there is no riddle, the thing is quite plain. Yesterday
when this animal appeared as piace de resistance at
dinner, the guests dismissed him3 and so to-day he
comae back to dinner as a freedman.” I cursed
my dullness and asked no more questions, for fear of
showing that 1 had never dined among decent people.

As we were speaking, a beautiful boy with vine-
leaves and ivy in his hair brought round grapes in a
little basket, impersonating Bacchus in ecstasy, Bacchus
full of wine, Bacchus dreaming, and rendering his
master’s verses in a most shrill voice. Trimalchio turned
round at the noise and said, “ Dionysus, rise and be
free.” Τὴε boy took the cap of freedom off the boar,
and put it on his head. Then Trimalchio went on:
“ 1 am sure you will agree that the god of liberation
is my father.¹' ¹ We applauded Trimalchio's phrase, and
kissed the boy heartily as he went round.

After this dish Trimalchio got up and retired.
With the tyrant away we had our freedom, and we
began to draw the conversation of our neighbours.
Dama began after calling for bumpers: Day is
nothing. Night is on you before you can turn round.
Then there is no better plan than going straight out
of bed to dinner. It is precious cold. 1 could scarcely
get warm in a bath. But a hot drink is asgoodasan
overcoat. I have taken some deep drinks² and 1 am
quite soaked. sse wine has gone to my head?

¹The name of the god Liber was saneifully derived from
the fact that wine frees men from cares. Trimalchio, who

confers freedom upon slaves, therefore takes him as his
patron or father.

¹ Staminatas means a draught of unmixed wine. Tne word
isvariously derived from the Greek amasos or the Latin stamen.
