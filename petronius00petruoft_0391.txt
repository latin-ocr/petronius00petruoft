POEMS

Thte hunter shakes the woods with his paek. The
anilor snatches his shipwrecked bark from the waves,
or grips it in death-agemaÎ‡ The woman writes bo her
lover, the adulteress yields herself: and the dog follows
the traeks of the hare as he sleeps. The wounds of
the unhappy endure into the night-season.
