POEMS

to add weight to the report. So was it that the greedy
slave, who feared to unlock his knowledge, dug in the
ground and betrayed the secret of the king’s hidden
ears. For the earth brought forth sounds, and the
whispering reeds sang how Midas was even such an
one as the tell-tale had revealed.

There sea and sky struggle and buffet each other, 14
here the tiny stream runs through smooth and smiling
country. There the sailor laments for ln's sunken ship,
here the shepherd dips his flock in the gentle river.
There death confronts and chokes the vast gape of
greed, here the earth laughs to lie low before the
curved sickle. There, with water everywhere, dry
thirst burns the throat, here kisses are given in plenty
to faithless man. Let Ulysses go sail and weary the

watffissin beggar’s rags: the chaste Penelope dwells
on .

The man that would not haste to die, nor force the 15
F ates to snap the tendet threads withimpetuous hand,
should know only this much of the sea's anger. Lo!
where the tide flows back, and the wave bathes his
feet without peril! Lo! where the mussel is thrown
up among the green sea—weed, and the hoarse whorl
of the slippery shell is rolled along! Lo! where the
wave turns the sands to rush back in the eddy, there
pebbles of many a hue appear on the wave-worn floor.
Let the man who may have these things under his

{Zea play safely on the shore, and count this alone to
e sea.
