APOCOLOCYNTOSIS

perufoggers putting their heads together, and lament-
ing their sad lot, up comes he and says: “Did not 1

When Claudius saw his own funeral train, he
realized that he was dead. For they were chanting
his dirge in anapaests, with much mopping and mouth-
ing:
“ Pour forth your laments‚ your sorrow declare,

Let the sounds of grief rise high in the air:

For he that is dead had a wit most keen,

Was bravest of all that on earth have been.

Racehorses are nothing to his swift feet:

Rebemous Parthians he did defeat;

Swifl: aster the Persians his light shaflzs go:

For he well knew how to fit arrow to bow,

Swistly the striped barbarians fled:

With one little wound he shot them dead.

And the Britons beyond in their unknown seas,

Blue-shielded Brigantians too, all these

He chained by the neck as the Romans' slaves.

He terrified Ocean with au his waves,

Made fear a new master to lay down the law.

O weep for the man! This world never saw

One quicker a troublesome suit to decide,

When only one part of the case had been tried,
(He could do it indeed and not hear either side).
Who’ll now sit in judgment the whole year round?
Now he that is judge of the shades underground
