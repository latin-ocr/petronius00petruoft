He knew the antidote to the fevered life which
burnt him up. His book is befouled with obscensty,
and, like obscenity itself‚ is ceasing by degrees to be
part of a gentleman’s education. But he will always
be read as a eritic; he tells admirable stories of were-
wolves and faithless widows3l he is one of the very
few novelists who can distil common talk to their pur-
pose without destroying its flavour. The translator
dulls his brilliance, and must leave whole pages in the
decent obscurity of Latin: he is fortunate if he adds
a few to those who know something of Petronius
beyond his name and the worst of his reputation.

The thanks of the editors and the translator are
due to Messrs. Weidmann of Berlin, who have gene-
rously placed at their disposal a copyright text of the
Satyricon, the epoch-making work of the late Pro-
fessor Buecheler.

Mr. H. E. Butler, Professor of Latin in the Uni-
versity of London, is responsible for the selection of
critical notes from Buecheler’s editio maior, the Intro-
duction to and text of the poems, and the Biblio-
graphy: the translator is indebted to him and to the
editors for invaluable assistance in attempting to meet
the difficulties which a rendering of Petronius con—

tinues to present.
