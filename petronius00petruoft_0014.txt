INTRODUCTION

‘⁸ His success aroused the jealousy of Tigellinus
against a possible rival—a professor of voluptuousness
better equipped than himself. Playing on the emperor’s
lust for cruelty‚ to which all other lusts were secon-
dary, 118 suborned a slave to turn informer, charged
Petronius with his friendship for Scaevinus, deprived
him of the opportunity of defence, and threw most 01
his household into prison.

“ At that time, it happened, the court had migrated
to Campania3 and Petronius had reached Cumae,
when his detention was ordered. He disdained to
await the lingering issue of hopes and fears: still, he
would not take a brusque farewell of life. An incision
was made in his veins: they were bound up under
his directions, and opened again, while he conversed
with his friends—not on the gravest of themes, nor
in the key of the dying hero. He listened to no dis-
quisitions on the immortality of the soul or the dogmas
of philosophy, but to frivolous song and playful verses.
Some of his slaves tasted of his bounty, others of the
whip. He sat down to dinner, and then drowsed a
little; so that death, if compulsory, should at least be
natural. Even in his will, he broke through the

routine of suicide, and flattered neither Nero nor ,

Tigellinus nor any other of the mighty: instead, he
described the emperor’s enormities; added a list of
his catamstes, his women, and his innovations in las-
civiousness3 then sealed the document, sent it to
Nero, and broke his signet-ring to prevent it from
being used to endanger others.”

The reflection arises at once that, given the Satyri-
con, this kind of book postulates this kind of author.

common to both. If books betray their writers
