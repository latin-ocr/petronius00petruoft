object unless they lay traps for the ear. A master of
oratory is like a fisherman3 he must put the particu-

little fish, or he may sit waiting on his rock with no
hope of a catch. Then what is to be done? It is the

for the fulfilment of their vows, they drive the unripe
schoolboy into the law courts, and thrust eloquence,
the noblest of calhngs, upon children who are still
struggling into the world. If they would allow work
to go on step by step, so that bookish boys were
steeped in diligent reading, their minds formed by
wise sayings‚ their pens relentless in tracking down
the right word, their ears giving a long hearing to
pieces they wished to imitate, and if they would con-
vince themselves that what took aboy’s fancy was never
fine; then the grand old style of oratory would have its
full force and splendour. As it is, the boy wastes his
time at school, and the young man is a laughing-stock in
the courts. worse than that, they will not admit when
they are old the errors they have once imbibed at school.
But pray do not think that Ι impugn Lucilius’s rhyme¹
about modesty. I will myself put my own views in a poem:

“ If any man seeks for success in stem art and applies
his mind to great tasks‚ let him first perfect his cha-
racter by the rigid law of frugality. Nor must he
care for the losty frown of the tyrant's palace, or
scheme for suppers with prodigals like a client, or
drown the fires of his wit with wine in the company
