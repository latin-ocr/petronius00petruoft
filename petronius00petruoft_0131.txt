by-night not worth his salt. In fact, when I’ve done
with him he won’t know where to take refuge. Upon
my word, I am not easily annoyed as a rule, but in
rotten flesh worms will breed. He laughs. What has
he got to laugh about ? Did his father pay solid gold
for him when he was a baby? A Roman knight, are
you? Well, Ι 3111 3 king’s son. ⁶ Then why have
you been a slave?' Because I went into service to
please myself, and preferred being a Roman citizen to
going on paying taxes as 3 provincial. And now Ι
hope 1 live such a life that no one 0311 jeer at me. Ι
3111 3 111311 among men3 Ι walk about bare-headed3 1
owe nobody a brass farthing3 Ι have never been in
the Courts; no one has ever said to me in public, ‘ Pay
me what you owe me.' Ι have bought a few acres and
collected a little capital; I have to feed twenty bellies
and a dog: Ι ransomed my fellow slave to preserve her
from indignities; Ι paid 3 thousand silver pennies for my
own freedom; I was made a priest of Augustus and ex-
cused the fees3 Ι hope to die so that I need not blush in

my grave. But are you so full of business that you have
no time to look behind you? You can see the lice on
others, but not the bugs on yourself. No one finds us
comic but you: there is your schoolmaster, older and
wiser than you ε 110 likes us. You are a child just weaned,
you cannot squeak out mu or ma, you are a clay-pot, 3
wash-leather in water, soster, not superior. If you are
richer, then have two breakfasts and two djnners a day.
Ι prefer my reputation to any riches. One word more.
Who ever had to speak to me twice? Ι was 3 513νο for
forty years, and nobody knew whether Ι was 3 slave
or free. I was 3 boy with long curls when Ι 031110
to this place3 they had not built the town-hall then.
