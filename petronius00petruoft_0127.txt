 

SATY RICON

· “ ‘sse high walls of Mars crumble beneath the gap- ⁴

ing jaws of luxury. To please thy palate the peacock
in his Babyloni-an vesture of gilded feathers is prisoned
and fed, for thee the guinea-fowl, and for thee the
capon. Even our beloved foreign guest the stork,
type of parental love, with thin legs and sounding
rattle, the bird exiled by winter, the harbinger of the
warm weather, has now built a nest in thine abhorred
cooking-pot. What are pearls of price, the fruits of
India, to thee? For thy wife to be adorned with sea-
spoils when she lies unchecked on a strange man's
bed? For what end dost thou require the green
emerald, the precious crystal, or the fire that lies in
the jewels of Carthage, save that honesty should shine
forth from amid the carbuncles? Thy bride might as
well clothe herself with a garment of the wind as stand
forth publicly naked under her clouds of muslin.'
“And now,’' said he, “what do we think is the
hardest profession aster writing? I think a doctor’s or a
money-changer’s. ΤΙιε doctor’s, because he knows what
poor men have in their insides, and when a sever will
come—though I detest them specially, because they
so osten order me to live on duck. The money-
changer’s, because he sees the copper under the silver.
Just so among the dumb animale, oxen and sheep are
the hardest workers: the oxen, because thanks to the
oxen we have bread to eat3 the sheep, because their
wool clothes us in splendour. It is a gross outrage
when people eat lamb and wear shirts. Yes, and 1
hold the bees to be the most divine insects. Tbey
vomit honey‚ although people do say they bring it
from Jupiter: and they have stings‚ because wherever

{ou have a sweet thing there you will find something
itter too.’'
