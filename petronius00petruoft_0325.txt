nec magis incepto vultum sermone movetur
quam lentae salices lassove papavera collo.

Nee minus ego 13111 106113 obiurgatione finita paeni-
tentiam agere sermonis mei coepi secretoque rubore

When my speech was over, I called Giton, and said,

“Now tell me, brother, on your honour. That night

when Ascyltos took you away from me, did he keep
