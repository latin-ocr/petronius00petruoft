SATYRICON

woman she was. The creature who had fallen down
was crawling round at our feet by this time, and
begging for mercy. 1 was very much afraid that his
petition was leading up to some comic surprise. The
cook who had forgotten to gut the pig had not yet
faded from my recollection. So I began looking all
round the dining-room, in case any clockwork toy
should jump out of the wall, especially after they had
begun to beat a servant for dressing the bruise on his
master’s arm with white wool instead of purple. And
my suspicions were not far out. Instead of punish-
ment there came Trimalchio’s decree that he should
be made a free man, for sear anyone might be able
to say that our hero had been wounded by a
slave.

We applauded his action, and made small talk in
different phrases about the uncertainty of man’ s affairs.

“‚”Ah said Trimalchio, ‘then we should not let this
occasion slip without a record.'' And he called at
once for paper, and aster very brief reflection de·
claimed these halting verses:

“What men do not look for turns about and comes
to pass. And high over us Fortune directs our affairs.
Wherefore, slave, hand us Falernian wine.’'

A discussion of poetry arose out of this epigram, and
for a long time it was maintained that Mopsus of
Thrace held the crown of song in his hand, until Tri-
malchio said, “,Now I ask you as a scholar, how would
you compare Cicero and Publilius?¹ In my opinion
the first has more eloquence, the second more beauty.
For what could be better written than these lines?

² Publi li us is Publili 1113 Sy rus, a famous writer of farce.1t
is not certain whether the verses which follow are actually
by him or not.
