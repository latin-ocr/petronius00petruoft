The sassor, naked from the shipwreck, seeks out a
comrade stricken by the s‘ame blow to whom he may
bewail his fate. The farmer who has lost his crops and
the whole year’s fruits in the hail, weeps his sad lot
on a bosom wounded like his own. Death draws the
unhappy together; bereaved parents utter their groans
with one voice, and the moment makes them equal.
We too will strike the stars with words in unison;
the saying is that prayers travel more strongly when
united.

You send me golden apples, my sweet Martia, and
you send me the fruit of the shaggy ehestnut. Believe
me, 1 would love them all; but should you choose
rather to come in person, lovely girl, you would
beautify.your gist. Come, if you will, and lay sour
apples to my tongue, the sharp flavour will be like
honey as I bite. But if you feign you wil] not come,
dearest, send kisses with the apples3 then gladly will
1 devour them.

If you are sister to Phoebus, Delia, Ι entrust my
petition to you, that you may carry to your brother
the words of my prayer. “God of Delphi, 1 have
built for you a temple of Sicilian marble, and have
given you fair words of song from a slender pipe of
reed. Now if you hear us, Apollo, and are indeed
divine, tell me where a man who has no money is to
find it.’'
