SATYRICON

musical comedy ‘⁶ Assafoetida ” in a most hideous voice.
We oeme to such an evil entertainment rather de-
pressed. “ Now,'' said Trimalchio, “let us have
dinner. This is sauce for the dinner.’' As he spoke,
four dancers ran up in time with the music and took
off the top part of the dish. Then we saw in the

figures of Marsyas at the corners of the dish also
caught the eye; they let a spiced sauce run from their
wine-skins over the fishes, which swam about in a kind

slaves started, and attacked these delicacies with hearty
laughter. Trimalchio was delighted with the trick

the music pulled the dish to piecoe3 you would have

accompaniment of a water-organ. Still- Trimalchio kept

word over and over again must be part of a joke, and

more often. “You see the fellow who is carving his
way through the meat? well, his name is Carver.
So whenever Trimalchio says the word, you have his
name, and he has his orders.” ¹

my neighbour to get as much news as possible. 1
began to seek for far-fetched stories, and to inquire
who the woman was who kept running about every-
where. “She is Trimalchio’s wife ForumataJ he said,
