made the whole thing out of a pig. There could not
be a more valuable fellow. If you want it, he will
make you a fish out of a sow’s belly, a woodpigeon out
of bacon, a turtledove out of a ham, and a chicken out
of a knuckle of pork. That gave me the idea of putting
a very pretty name on him3 he is called Daedalus.l
And because he is so intelligent, Ι brought him back
from Rome some knives‚ made of steel of Noricum, as

Suddenly two slaves came in who had apparently
been fighting at a water-tank; at least they still had
waterpots on their necks. Trimalchio sat in judgment
on the dispute, but neither of them accepted his
decision, and they smashed each other's waterpots
with sticks. We were amazed at their dmnken folly¹
and stared at them fighting, and then we saw oysters
and cockles fall out of the pots, and a boy picked them
up and brought them round on a dish. The elever
cook was a match for this exhibition3 he offered us
snails on a silver gridiron, and sang in an extremely
ugly quavering voice.

I am ashamed to tell you what followed: in defiance
of all convenfflon, some long-haired boys brought oint-
ment in a silver basin, and anointed our feet as we lay,
aster winding little garlands round our feet and ankles.
A quantity of the same ointment was then poured into
the mixing· bowl 31111 the lamp.

Fortunata had now grown anxious to dance3 Scin-
tilla clapped her 11311113 ‘more osten than she spoke,
when Trimalchio said,“Philargy1-us, you and Cario,
