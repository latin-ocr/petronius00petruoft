POEMS

Every man shall find his own deslre3 there is no l

Phoebus was looking winterwards with cooler reins.
Now the plane-tree had begun to shed down her
leaves, now the young shoots had withered on the
vine, and she had begun to number her grapes: the
whole promise of the year was standing before our

eyes.

It was fear first created gods in the world, when the 3

lightning fell from high heaven, and the ramparts of the
world were rent with flame, and Athos was smitten and

blazed. Soon 'twas Phoebus sank to earth, aster he
had traversed earth from his rising3 the Moon grew

old and once more renewed her glory ; next the starry
signs were spread through the firmament, and the

year divided into changing seasons. The folly spread,
and soon vain superstition bade the' labourer yield to
Ceres the harvest's chosen firstfruits, and garland
Bacchus with the fruitful vine, and made Pales to
rejoice in the shepherd’s work3 Neptune swims deep-
plunged beneath all the waters of the world, Pallas
watches over shops, and the man who wins his prayer
or has betrayed the world for gold now strives greedily

to create gods of his own.

sweet nard, nor strive to win my stomach with familiar
