SATYRICON

''Whatever thou καὶ in the world is obedient w
me. ΤΙιε flowery earth, when I will, faints and
, witha-rs as its juices dry, and, when 1 will, pours forth

its richen, while rocks and rough crags spurt waters
wide as the Nile. The great sea lays its waves
lifeloes before me, and the winds lower their blasts

f in silence at my feet. ΤΙιε rivers obey me, and
’ζ Hymnian tigers, and serpents‚ whom 1 bid stand
Ξ still. But 1 will not tell you of small things3 the

shape of the moon is drawn down to me by my

’ spells, and Phoebus trembles and must turn his
’ fierysteedsas 1 compel him backinhiscourse. So

great is the power of words. The flaming spirit of
bulls is quenched and calmed by a maiden's rites, and
Circe, the child of Phoebus, transfigured Ulyssoe’s
crew with magic songs, and Proteus can take what
form he will. And 1, who am cunning in thoee arts,
ean plant the bushes of Mount Ida in the sea, or set

, rivers back on lofty peaks.”

1 shrank m horror from her promised miraclae, and

began to look at the old woman more carefiilly..
“,’'Now cried Oenothea, ‘obey my orders!” and she

wiped her hands oerefully, leaned over the bed, and

³ kissed me once, twice.

Oenothea put up an old table m the middle of the
altar, and covered it with live ceals, and repaired a
wine-cup that had cracked from age with warm pitch.
Then she drove in once more on the smoky wall a
nail which had come away with the wooden wine·
cup when she took it down. Then she put on a
aquare cloak, and laid an enormous cooking-pot on the
hearth, and at the same time took off the meat-books

‚ with a fork a bag which had in it some beans put by for

use, and some very mouldy piecoe of a brain smashed into
