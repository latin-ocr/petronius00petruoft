SATYRICON

woman who has known a man first this very year,
deur youth, Ι will give you a new sister. True, you
have a brother, too, for I made bold to inquire, but
why should you not take to yourself a sister as well?
1 will come as the same kind of relation. Deign only
to recognize my kiss also when it is your good
Pl “1 should rather implore you by your beauty,” 1
replied‚ “ not to scorn to enrol a stranger among your
worshippers. You will find me a true votam, if you
allow me to kneel before you. And do not think that
1 would enter this shrine of Love without an offering3
1 will give you my own brother.”

“What,” she said, “you give me the one without
whom you cannot live, on whose lips you hang, whom
you love as I would have you love me?'’ Even as
she spoke grace made her words so attractive, the
sweet noise fell so sostly upon the listening air, that
you seemed to have the harmony of the Sirens ringing
in the breeze. Soas Ι marvelled, and all the light oi
the sky somehow fell brighter up‘on‘me, Ι was moved
to ask my goddess her name. Then my maid did
not tell you that 1 am called Circe?’' she said. “1 am
not the Suu-child indeed, and my mother has never
stayed the moving world in its course while she will.
But I shall have a debt to pay to Heaven if fate brings
you and me together. Surely now, the Gods with
their quiet thoughts have some plan in the making.
Circe does not love Polyaenus ¹ without good reason;
when these two names meet, a great fire is always set
ablaze. Then take me in your embrace if you like.

¹ Polyaenus is the name assumed by Encolpius at Croton.

Circe in the Odyssey (Book X) is daughter of the Sun. Cf.
e. 134: Phoebeia Circe.
