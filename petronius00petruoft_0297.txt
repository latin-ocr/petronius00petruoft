SATYRICON
leaned onhis tall spear and crushed the rough ground

, with fearloes tread, like the son of Amphitryon1 hasten-

ing down from a high peak of Caucasus, or the fierce
countenance of Jupiter, when he descended from the
heights of great Olympus and scattered the arms os
the doomed Giants.

“While Caesar treads down the swelling peaks in his
wrath, Rumour flies swift in terror with beating wings,
and seeks out the lofty top of the tall Palatine. Then
she strikes 311 the images of the gods with her message
of Roman thunder: how ships are now sweeping the
sea, and the horsemen red with German blood pouring'
hotly over the range of the Alps. Battle, blood,
slaughter, fite, and the whole 'picture of war flits
before their eyes. Their hearts shake in confusion,
and are fearfully divided between two counsels.
One man chooses flight by land, another trusts rather
to the water, and the open sea now safer than his
own country. Some prefer to attempt a fight and
turn Fate's decree to account. As deep as a man’s
fear is, so far he flies. In the turmoil the people
themselves, a woeful sight, are led swiftly out of
the deserted city, whither their stricken heart drives
them. Rome is glad ιο- flee, her true sons are
cowed by war, and at a rumour’s breath leave their
houses to mourn. One holds his children with a
shaking hand, one hides his household gods in his
bosom, and weeping, leaves his door and calls down
death on the unseen enemy Some elasp their wives
to them in tears, youths carry their aged sires, and,
nnused to burdens‚ take with them only what they
dread to lose. The fool drags all his goods after him,
and marches lade'n with booty to the battle: and

¹ Hercules ε he came down to rescue Prometheus.
