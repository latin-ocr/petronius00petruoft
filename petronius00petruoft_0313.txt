SATYRICON

Yon need have no fear of any spy; your brother is far
away from here.”

Circe was silent, folded me in two arms softer than
a bird's wing, and drew me to the ground on a carpet
of coloured flowers.

“ Such flowers as Earth, our mother, spread on Ida's
top when Jupiter embraced her and she yielded her
love, and all his heart was kindled with fire: rosoe
glowed there, and violets, and the tender flowering
rush; and white lilies laughed from the green grass:
such a soil summoned Venus to the soft grasses, and
the day grew brighter and looked kindly on ‘their
hidden pleasure.’'

We lay together there among the flowers and ex-
changed a thousand light kisses, but we looked for
§teg-ner play..

“Tell me,’ 'she cried,‘ do you find no joy in my
lips? Nor m the breath that saints with hunger? Nor
in my body wet with heat? If it is none of these,
are you afraid of Giton?'’ I crimsoned with blushes
under her eyes, and lost any strength I might have had
before, and cried as though there were no whole
partin my body, ‘Dear lady, have mercy, do not mock
my ngef. Some poison has infected me.” . . .

“Speak to me, Chrysis, tell me true: am Ι ugly or
untidy? Is there some natural blemish that darkens
my beauty? Do not deceive your own mistress. Ι know
not how, but I have sinned.” She then snatched a
glass from the silent girl, and aster trying every look
that raises a smile to most lovers’ lips, she shook out
the cloak the earth had stained, and hurried into the
temple of Venus. But I was lost and horror-stricken
as if I had seen a ghost, and began to inquire of my
beart whether 1 was eheated of my true delight.
