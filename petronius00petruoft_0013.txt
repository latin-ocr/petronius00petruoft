INTRODUCTION

Tm: author of the Satyricon is identified by the large
majority of scholars with Gaius Petronius,¹ the cour-
tier of Nero. There is a long tradition in support of
the identification, and the probability that it is cor-
rect appears especially strong in the light of Tacitus’s
account of the character and death of Gaius Petronius
in the eighteenth and nineteenth chapters of the six-
teenth book of the Annals. Mr. John Jackson has
translated the passage as follows:

” “ Petronius deserves a word in retrospect. He was
a man who passed his days in sleep, his nights in the
ordinary duties and recreations of life: others had
achieved greatness by the sweat of their brows—
Petronius idled into fame. Unlike most who walk
the road to ruin, he was never regarded as either
debauchee or wastrel, but rather as the finished artist
in extravagance. In both word and action, he dis-
played a freedom and a sort of sels-abandonment
which were welcomed as the indiscretions of an un·
sophisticated nature. Yet, in his proconsulship of
Bithynia, and later as consul elect, he showed himself
an energetic and capable administrator. Then came
the revulsion: his genuine or affected vices won him
admittance into the narrow circle of Nero’s intimates,
and he became the Arbiter of Elegance, whose sanc-

tion alone divested pleasure of vulgarity and luxury of
grossness.
