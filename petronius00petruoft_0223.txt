SATYRICON

abouts’· Ascyltos stood close by the crier in clothes
of many eolours, holding out the reward on a silver-
dish to prove his honesty. I told Giton to get under
the bed at once, and hook his feet and hands into the
webbing which held up the mattress on the frame, so
that he might evade the grasp of searchers by stay-
ing siretched out under the bed, just as Ulysses of old
clung on to the ram of the Cyclops.l Giton obeyed
orders at once, and in a second had slipped his hands
into the webbing‚ and surpassed even Ulysses at his
own tricks. I did not want ιο leave any room for
suspicion, so Ι stuffed the bed with clothes, and
arranged them in the shape of a man about my own
height sleeping by himself.

Meanwhile Ascyltos went round all the rooms with
a constable, and when he came to mine, his hopes
swelled within him at finding the door bolted with
especial eure. The municipal slave put an axe into the
joints, and loosened the bolts from their place. 1 fell
at Ascyltos's feet, and besought him, by the memory
of our friendship and the miseries we had shared, at
least ιο show me my brother. Further ιο win belief
in my sham prayers, 1 said, “1 know you have come
to kill me, Ascyltos. Else why have you brought an
axe with you? Well, satisfy your rage. Here is my
neck, shed my blood, the real object of your pre—
tended legal search? Ascyltos threw off his resent-
ment, and declared that he wanted nothing but his own
runaway slave, that he did not desire the death of any
man or any suppliant, much less of one whom he loved
very dearly now that their deadly dispute was over.

¹ See Homer’s odyssey, Book ix. Ulysses escaped from
the den of the Cyclops Polyphemus by clinging to the beuy
of a ram, when Polyphemus sent out his flocks to graze.
