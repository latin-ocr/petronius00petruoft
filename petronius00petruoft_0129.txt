SATYRICON

He was just throwing the philosophers out of work,
when tickets were carried round in a cup, and 3 boy
who was entrusted with this duty read aloud the
names of the presents for the guests. ¹ “Tainted
metal ”3 a 113111 was brought 111 with a vinegar bottle
011 top of it. “Something soft for the neck'' ; a serap
of neck-end was put on. “Repenting at leisure and
obstinate badness” ; we were given biscuits made with
must, and a thick stick with 311 apple. “Leeks and
peacfies”; he took a scourge and a dagger. “-Spar
rows and fly- -''paper ;he picked up some dried grapes
and a honey- -pot. “Evening-dress and outdoor
clothes⁹¹ 3 he handled a piece of meat and some
note· books.‘ ‘Canal and foot- -measure '; a hare and a
slipper were introduced. “Τ116 muraena and a letter” ;
116 took a mouse and 3 frog tied together, and 3 bun-
dle of beetroot. We laughed loud and long: there
were any number of these jokes, which have now
aeoeped my memory.

Ascyltos let himself go completely, threw up 1113
hands and made fun of everything‚ and laughed till
he cried. This annoyed one of Trimalchio’s fellow-
freedmen, the man who was sitting next above me.

“What are you laughing at, sheep’ s head?’' he said.

“Are our host’ 3 good things not good enough for
you? I suppose you are richer and used to better
living? As I hope to have the spirits of this place 011
my side, if I had been sitting next him Ι should have

pu¹t 3 stopper on his bleating by now. A nice young

'Apophoreta are presents for guests to carry away. It
was customary to hand tickets to them on which ru iddles con-
cealing the names of the presents were written. Trimalchio' s
jokes depend upon allusions to li kenesses between 1116 words

in the riddle and the name of the present, and are therefore
impossible to render in English.
