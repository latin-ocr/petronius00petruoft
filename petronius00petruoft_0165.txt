SATYRICON

though you are a damned wearer of the green,l may m't
down and tell your good woman, Menophila, to do the
same? Ι 1133(1 hardly say that we were nearly pushed
off the sosas with the slaves erowding into every seat.
Anyhow, I noticed that the cook, who had made a
80033 out of the pig, sat stinking of pickle and sauces
just above me. Not satisfied with having a seat, he at
once began to imitate the tragedian Ephesus, and
then invited 1113 own master to make a bet on the
green being Επεὶ 111 ὶ113 next games.
Trimalchio cheered up at this dispute and said,
“,Ah my friends, a slave is a man and drank his
motfier’ s milk like ourselves‚ even if cruel fate has
trodden him down. Yoe, and if I live they shall soon
taste the water of steedom. In fact 1 am setting them

bed and bedding.1 ammaking Fortunata my heir,
and 1 recommend her to all my friends. I am making
all this known so that my slaves may love me now as 11
Ι were (133(1.” They all began to thank their master
for 1113 kindness, when he turned serious, and had a
copy of the will brought· 111, which he read aloud from
beginning to end, while the slaves moaned and groaned.
Then he looked at Habinnas and said‚‘ ‘Now tell me,
my (1331· friend: you will creet a monument as 1 have
directed? Ι beg you earnestly ὶο put up round the
feet of my statue my little dog, and some wreaths‚ and
bottles of perfume, and all the fights of Petraites‚ ²
