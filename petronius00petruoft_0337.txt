SATYRICON

deep, with vinegar. Then, being afraid of a scolding,
Ι made a plan for getting away, put my things to-
gether, and started to leave the house. Ι had not yet

got outside the room, when Ι saw Oenothea coming
with a jar full of live coals. So I drew back and threw

⁷ off my cont, and stood in the entrance as if 1 were

waiting for her return. She made up a fire which
she raised out of some broken reeds, and after heaping
on a quantity of wood‚ began to apologize for her delay,

saying that her friend would not let her go until the
customary three glasses had been emptied. “What did

you do while Ι was away?’' she went on, “and where
are the beans?” Thinking that Ι had done some-

, thing which desei-ved a word of praise, Ι described

the whole of my fight in detail, and to put an end to
her depression Ι produced the goose as a set-off to her·
lossae. When the old woman saw the bird, she
raised such a great shriek that you would have thought
that the geaee had come back into the room again. Ι
was astonished and shocked to find so strange a
crime at my door, and I asked her why she had
flared up, and why she should be more sorry for the
goose than for me. But she beat her hands together
and said‚‘ ‘You villain, you dare to speak. Do γοα
not know what a dreadful sin you have committed?
You have killed the darling of Priapus, the goose
beloved of all married women. And do not suppose
that it is not serious; if any magistrate finds out, on
the cross you go. My house was spotless until to-day,
and γοα have deffled it with blood, and you have given
any enemy of mine who likes the power to turn me
out of my priaethoodf

“Not such a noise‚ pie‘asey Ι said3‘ ‘1 will give you
an ostrich to replace the goose.'
