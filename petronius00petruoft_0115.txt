SATYRICON

eyes saw the Sibyl hanging in a cage; and when the
boys cried at her: ς Sibyl, Sibyl, what do you want?
‘I would that l were dead,' she used to answer.’'l
He had still more talk to puff out, when the table
was filled by a dish holding an enormous pig. We
began to express astonishment at such speed, and
took our oath that not even a fowl could have been
properly cooked in the time, especially as the pig
seemed to us to be much bigger than the boar had
been a little while earlier. Trimalchio looked at it
more and more closely and then said, “What, what,
has not this pig been gutted? I swear it has not.
The cook, send the cook up here to us.” The poor
cook came and stood by the table and said that he
had forgotten to gut it. “ What? Forgotten?” shouted
Trimalchio. “You would think the fellow had only
forgotten to season it with pepper and cummin. Off
with his shirt!” In a moment the cook was stripped
and stood dolefully between two executioners. Then we
all began to beg him off and say: “These things will
happen; do let him go; if he does it again none of us
will say a word for him.'’ Ι was as stiff and stern as
could be; I could not restrain myself, but leaned over
and said in Agamemnon’s ear: ‘ This must be a most
wretched servant; how could anyone forget to gut a
pig? On my oath I would not forgive him if he had
let a fish go like that.” But Trimalchio's face sostened
into smiles. “Well,’' he said, “if your memory is so
bad, clean him here in front of us.” The cook put
on his shirt, seized a knife, and carved the pig’s belly
in various places with a shaking hand. At once the
¹ Sibyls were said to live to a great age ; their mummies

continued to be exhibited aster their death. A confusion with
*he myth of Tithonus, who was turned into a grasshopper.
