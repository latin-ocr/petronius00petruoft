mpkin with a broad stripe and fringes hanging from it
all round. On the little finger of his left hand he had an
enormous gilt ring, and on the top joint of the next finger
a smaller ring which appeared to me to be entirely
gold, but was really set all round with iron cut out in
little stars. Not content with this display of wealth‚
he bared his right arm, where a golden bracelet shone‚
and an ivory bangle clasped with a plate of bright
metal. Then he said, as he picked his teeth with a
silver quill, “lt was not convenient for me to come
to dinner yet, my friends, but Ι gave up all my own
pleasure3 I did not like to stay away any longer and
keep you waiting. But you will not mind if I finish

ἡ my game?’' A boy followed him with a table of tere-

binth wood and crystal pieces, and I noticed the
prettiest thing possible. Instead of black and white
counters they used gold and silver coins. Trimalchio
kept passing every kind of remark ashe played, and
we were still busy with the hors d’oeuvres, when a tray
was brought in with a basket on it, in which there was
a hen made of wood, spreading out her wings as they
do when they are sitting. ΤΙἏΕ music grew loud: two
slaves at once came up and began to hunt in the straw.
Peahen's eggs were pulled out and handed to the
guests. Trimalchio turned his head to look, and said,
‘1 gave orders, my friends, that peahen's eggs should
be put under a common hen. And upon my oath Ι
am afraid they are hard-set by now. But we will try
whether they are still fresh enough to suck.'' We
took our spoons, half-a-pound in weight at least, and
hammered at the eggs, which were balls of fine meal.
Ι was on the point of throwing away my portion. 1
thought a peachick had already formed. But hearing
a practised diner say, “ What treasure have we here?”
