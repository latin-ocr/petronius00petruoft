INTRODUCTION

the story becomes fragmentary once more, and declines
in interest almost as much as in decency. Its attraction
lies in the verse and criticism put into the mouth of
Eumolpus, a debased poet whom Encolpius meets in
a picture gallery. With him the adventures of the
trio continue. There is a lodging-house brawl, a
voyage where they find themselves in the hands of
old enemies, the ship’s captain Lichas, whose wife
Hedyle they appear to have led astray, and Try-
phaena, a peripatetic courtesan who takes the Medi-
terranean coast for her province, and has some unex-
plained claim on Giton’s affections. They settle these
disputes only to be involved in a shipwreck and (nst
ashore at Croton, where they grow fat on their pre-
tension to be men of fortune, and disappear from
sight, Encolpius after a disgraceful series of vain
encounters with a woman named Circe, and Eumolpus
after a scene where he bequeaths his body to be caten
by his heirs.

Coherence almost fails long before the end: the
episode in which Encolpius kills a goose, the sacred
bird of Priapus, gives a hint, but no more, that the
wrath of Priapus was the thread on which the whole
Satyricon was strung. But the life of the later portions
of the novel lies in the critical and poetical fragments
scattered through it. These show Petronius at his
best as a lord of language, a great critic, an intelligent
enthusiast for the traditions of classical poetry and
oratory. The love of style which was stronger in him
even than his interest in manners doubly enriches his
work. It brings ready to his pen the proverbs with
their misleading hints of modernity,1 the debased
syntax and abuse of gender, which fell from common
