INTRODUCI'ION

> characteristica, Gaius Petronius, as seen by Tacitus,

had the imagination and experience needed to depict
the adventures of Encolpius.

There is a little evidence, still based on the primary
assumption, more exactin its bearing. The satyr-icon
contains a detailed criticism of and 3 poem directed
against the style of a writer who must be Lucan. Gaius
Petronius was not the man to pass over the poet,
epigrammatist, and courtier, in whose epoch and circle

, he himself shone. He may have deplored Lucan's

poetic influence, but he could not neglect it, for Lucan
was essentially the singer of his own day. No age was
so favourable as that of Nero for the introduction into
a supremely seandalous tale of 3 reasoned and appreci-
ative review of the Pharsalia, the outstanding poem
of the time.

ΤΙιε criticism of the schools of rhetoric in their
effect upon education and language, and the general
style of the book in reflective and descriptive passages,
point more vaguely to a similar date of composition.

Gaius Petronius found in his work 3 form which
allowed complete expression to the many sides of his
active and uncontrolled intellect. Its loose construc-
tion is matched by its indifference to any but stylistic
reforms ; it draws no moral ; it is solely and properly
occupied in presenting an aspect of things seen by a
loiterer at one particular corner of the world. What
we possess of it is a fragment, or rather a series of
excerpts from the fifteenth and sixteenth books, we
know not how representative of the original whole.
